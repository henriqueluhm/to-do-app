## About the application:
Simple and easy to use to do app with a clean interface. It has a area where the user can type the things that he or she want/must/have to do. 
The tasks will be submitted and it will appear in another area, where the person can mark with a checkmark if the task is done.
On the top part, there is a menu that allows the user to select the day of the week to put new tasks, or check if its all good.
